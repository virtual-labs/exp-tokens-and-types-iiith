Bipasha annoyed due to misbehavior. Bipasha storms out of film festival Goa. If it's wrong, even the celebrities get angry. The atmosphere soured at the 36th International Film Festival that began at Panaji on Thursday, when the security guards on duty there misbehaved with the Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu. Bipasha was left fuminating with anger due to the security guards' misconduct, and though at first she confronted the guards there itself, later she left without participating in the festival given her anger. It should be noted that Bipasha was the one who had to light the lamps in the ceremony and later had to participate in the entire program. But the atmosphere got vitiated due to her storming out of the festival. Though, the senior officials have promised an investigation into the matter, no action has been taken so far against the guard who had misbehaved with the bengali beauty. Prakash Jha's new film, Apharana, is due to be premiered at the film festival. After Gangajal, this is Jha's second film to be made on an off topic. Bipasha too, as an actress has worked in this film. Ajay Devgan has played the male lead against her in the film. Since Apharan was to be premiered there, Bipasha's presence was all the more important. Earlier, the 36th International Film Festival at Panaji was inaugrated with much fanfare and a colourful carnival. Extensive security arrangements have been made by the administration for the festival and it does not want to leave anything to chance. According to another news item, changing the program, Dev Anand has decided not to screen his new film 'Mister Prime Minister' at the International Film Festival. In fact, he wants to screen this film for Prime Minister Manhoman Singh first. Talking to a TV Channel on Thursday, Dev Anand said that he does not want to enter his film in the festival for many reasons. He first wants to show it to the prime Minister. Dev Anand said that his film would be released on the 30th of November

Now Maoists will conduct Panchayati Elections in Jharkhand IANS Ranchi. Taking on the role of the government in Jharkhand, the Maoists Guerillas have said, they will soon hold Panchayati elections in the state. It should be noted that Panchayati Elections have not been held in Jharkhand for the last 28 years. The Maoists took this decision at their Central Committee's meeting held at Dhanbad last year. A source close to the Maoists said, the Maoists believe that the Panchayati Elections will help settle the various disputes and disagreements among the people in rural Jharkhand. According to sources, the Maoists have decided to hold the Panchayati elections in the state in multiple stages. But they would not be similar to any of the elections held by the Central Election Commission. The Maoists have said that detailed information in this regard would be realeased at a later date. Reacting to the Maoists decision, a senior police officer engaged in anti operations said that this is an attempt by the Maoists to influence the poor in the state. To thwart the Maoists' designs the state government must hold the Panchayati elections as soon as possible in the state. It should be remembered, that Jharkhand separated from Bihar in November, 2000. And for the past 28 years no Panchayats have been formed in this region. Panchayati Elections were held in Bihar in 2001, but in Jharkhand no steps have been taken in this regard. The Arjun Munda government has announced that it might conduct Panchayati Elections by the years end. The Jharkhand High Court has also expressed its displeasure at Panchayati Elections not being held for a long time in the state. It must also be noted, that due to the Panchayats not being formed in the state, Jharkhand has had to forego its share of the 500 crores central grant made available by the Centre to Panchayats every year.

Yadav said at the party meeting on Friday that the third front would maintain an equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress. He said SP is fighting against the BJP in the state and it's because of this that many senior leaders of the saffron party had to face defeat in Uttar Pradesh.

Yadav said that when we were working to oust the BJP, NULL the Congress was trying to weaken SP.

Sudarshan lambasts Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah Sheikh Abdullah responsible for Mukherjee's murder. RSS Chief K C Sudarshan blamed Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah for the country's religious, political and social problems at a Swayam Sewak meet held at the local mini stadium here. He said Congress's support of the 1920's Khilafat movement was a mistake. Due to this, muslims dominated the nation. He accused the Sheikh Abdullah government of having a hand in Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's murder. He was murdered in prison by being fed wrong medicines. The RSS chief reiterated that the Sangh has different bodies but one ideology. Sudarshan said, the Indian muslims did not like the fact that the British had dispossessed Turkey of the Khalifa's chair during the first world war. Mahatma Gandhi decided to support the protests initiated by the Muslim society against this. Dr. Hedgewar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya protesting against this warned against its negative impact. But Gandhi dismissed this. For two years Gandhi supported the movement touring the country alongwith Maulana Mohammad Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali. But the British crushed the movement in the country. Malabar's Hindus had to face the resulting consequences. Muslims let out their anger over the dispossession of the Khalifa's chair and the failure of the Khilafat movement by butchering 1500 hindus and by converting twenty thousand during the Malabar riots of 1923. Sangh's second chief Madhavrao Sadashirao Gowalkar had warned, even before Dr. Shayama Prasad Mukherjee's entry into Jammu and Kashmir and Lal Bahadur Shastri's tour of Tashkent, of the threat to the life of these leaders. He said that twenty years later Jinnah again instigated Muslim League workers over the demand of Pakistan. Jinnah also instigated riots during the period of 1940-47. In these conditions the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh workers took on the task of saving and resettling the Hindus. At that time the country's leaders were celebrating independence while the Sangh workers were defending the nation. Sacrifices of a number of Swyam Sevaks prove this. Sudarshan said that though the Sangh is agitating to make the country a Hindu nation, during the freedom struggle many Sangh workers had individually participated in it. He said the small plant of the Hindu Nation that Dr. Hedgewar had sown in 1940, would turn 80 years old on the coming Vijaydashmi. Four generations of the Sangh have contributed to this. In the political arena, remarking about the Jana Sangh and the BJP, Sudarshan credited Guru Gowalkar with this. On Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's advice he had brought people like, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Kusha Bhau Thakre, Sunder Singh Bhandari, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani into politics. These people formed the BJP after Janta Party leaders' condition of severing ties with RSS in 1977. Sudarshan said each body is independent but there can be no compromise over ideology. Sudarshan said on Guru Govalkar's hundredth birth anniversary the Sangh would hold celebrations. He asked the workers to propogate the Sangh's work and guard against cultural invasions.

Lalu's younger brother rebels Pre Patna. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo, Lalu Prasad Yadav's brother Subhash Yadav has rebelled against him protesting over wrongful distribution of party tickets. Subhash is a Rajya Sabha member from the party. He said that RJD tickets were being given to scamsters and others at the expense of real party workers. Having lost power in Bihar, Lalu is facing the most difficult assembly election in his life yet. He said, it's been hinted that a ticket would be given to the fodder scam accused R.K Rana's son, whereas the real party workers who've helped build the party have been denied party tickets. He said the RJD president wants to give a ticket to Rana so that he does not appear as a government witness in the fodder scam. Because Lalu himself is an accused in this matter. Lalu's wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi's youngest brother Subhash Yadav accused RJD's senior leader Jagdanand Singh of working against party interests. Without naming RJD's national spokesman Shivanand Tiwari, Subhash charged Lalu over the fact that the elction symbol was sent to his residence. Similarly, Patna's RJD member Ram Kripal Yadav was accused of working against the party's official candidates from Danapur, Bikramganj and Paliganj. Lalu's youngest brother said that the people who had contributed very little towards strengthening the party, were being bestowed tickets while the real party worker had to wait in front of 1 Anne Marg as part of the crowd. He strongly objected to the suggestion that he had rebelled because his wife Renu Devi had been denied a ticket. Subhash said he's not part of the race.

Prisons, dens of criminal activities Govind Singh New Delhi. The suicide of an undertrial in Agra, and the death of another from heart failure has again unmasked the terrible conditions prevalent inside Indian prisons. The country has more than 1200 jails. And it's common for a number of prisoners to die in these jails each year. Sometimes they die of beatings by the prison wardens while at others, they commit suicide due to the torture and shameful treatment meted out to them in these prisons. Not to mention those that die due to diseases borne out of dreadful prison conditions and lack of medical help. Infact prisons are turning into dens of criminal activities these days. Politicians, police officers and criminals all collude in this. A number of committees were formed for prison reforms but their recommendations were never implemented. Even the capital's Tihar Jail is not immune to such incidents. Tihar has seen 116 deaths in the last five years. Recently, last April, a 32 year old prisoner named Chandrabhan Singh died in suspicious circumstances. Before this on 20th March another prisoner, Rajesh Kumar hanged himself in a toilet within the prison premises. In Ghaziabad's Dasna jail 48 prisoners have died so far. After the mysterious death of a prisoner named Qamruddin over there, a jail official killed 100 pigeons kept by another prisoner to torture him. Past May in Varanasi, Santosh Gupta killed a prisoner named Annu tripathi in a gang. In West Begal's Jailpaiguri district's Alipurdwar prison, a young prisoner Prajit Das had died under mysterious circumstances in March. He was a worker of a party calling for a separate Kamtapur state. These are a few examples that speak of the deplorable conditions in jails and the prevalent anarchy inside them. Why are our prisons in such a bad condition? The biggest reasons are our slow moving justice system and an irresponsible government machinery. According to the statistics from the National Human Rights Commission the country's prisons held 336152 prisoners in 2004. Whereas all these jails have the capacity to hold just 237617 prisoners. Of these, only 20 percent prisoners were serving sentences and 75 percent were undertrials. These prisoners keep waiting for their trials to begin. The strange story of undertrial prisoners had come out in the report of the Human Rights Commission itself. 5 such prisoners were found in Assam's Tejpur jail alone, who had been rotting in prison for more than 30 years without cases having been brought against them. Out of them, one Machang Lalung is now 77 years old. He's been rotting in prison for the past 55 years. All these five prisoners are now mental patients and are lodged in the mental hospital there. Lalung was produced in court for the last time on 7th August, 1967. He doesn't speak anymore. It's very easy for a prisoner to go insane given the conditions inside the prisons. The endless wait for trials to begin pushes these undertrial prisoners over the edge. Usually, they are branded criminals even if they have or have not committed crimes. And be it the prison workers or the police, all of them treat them as criminals. They are tortured to confess to their crimes. A prisoner has to face corruption at every step. Even to meet their relatives they have to bribe the jail staff. Some prisoners say that the physical torture can still be endured but the way the jail staff misbehave and abuse them is intolerable. But on the other hand, criminal bosses use the jail as centres for all kinds of activities. A number of crime bosses run their gangs from here and it's all done with the collusion of the jail staff.

Net tightens around Dawood Ibrahim Interpol will issue 'Special International Notice' Agencies New Delhi. The net around underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, India's most wanted criminal, said to be living in Pakistan, is tightening at the international level. Interpol has decided to issue a 'Special International Notice' against him. This notice is issued against those who are listed by the United Nations for having relations with Al and Taliban. Dawood would be banned from entering 184 countries after this notice is issued. All these countries can now seize his properties. A red corner notice has already been issued against Dawood. America too has included him in its terrorist list. Official sources said that a proposal was passed at Interpol's General Meeting in Berlin last year in which it was decided to issue 'Special International Notices' against those associated with Al and Taliban. India too had participated in this meeting. This notice would be sent to all the 184 member countries. Pakistan too, is among these countries. Due to this, Pakistan would face increasing political pressure to give up Dawood, who's hiding there under a false identity. Other than this, Dawood's movements between countries, with the use of fake passports and documents would also be curbed. Based on United Nation's proposal 1267, Dawood's name has been included in the list of terrorists. The 1993 mumbai blast accused Dawood has been listed as an Indian citizen in the United Nation's list, where his place of birth is registered as Ratnagiri in Maharashtra and his Indian passport is 'A'. India belives that Dawood is living in the Pakistani city of Karachi, and is engaged in his terrorist activities from there. He also keeps commuting to Dubai. America had termed Dawood as an international terrorist in 2003. After this America had knocked at the United Nation's doors to seize his properties. Pakistan's troubles can increase once Interpol's notice against Dawood is issued.

3 crores to LJP legislators was minister's proposal Raghuvansh Prasad accuses NDA Pre New delhi. RJD's senior leader and Central Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has made the accusation that LJP legislators were offered 3 crore rupees, ministerial berths, and legislative council memberships for their wives, to switch sides. He said that NDA had played dirty politics to form a government in Bihar. On the occassion of the Rural Development Department's state secretaries meet on Wednesday, Prasad said that NDA had harmed democracy. He termed the act of dissolving the Bihar Assembly as a late but just decision. He said there was no option but to dissolve the house to stop the horse of legislators. Criticizing the BJP led NDA for indulging in the house of legislators, Prasad said that RJD had staked its claim to form the government on emerging as the largest party after the elections. Whereas NDA, rather than staking a claim had asked the Governor not to invite Lalu Prasad to form the government. Prasad said that NDA had kept the abducted legislators from Jharkhand in Rajasthan, whereas the ones abducted from Bihar were taken to Jharkhand. Regarding the election dates he said that the decision rests entirely with the Election Commission in this matter. Dodging the question on the matter of the possible polarisation of political forces before the elections, he said that a complete coalition would be formed before the elections. Regarding the alliance with LJP he said, we will finish off the NDA, with or without Paswan.
