A wolf carried off a lamb. The lamb said, " I know you are going to eat me, but before you eat me I would like to hear you play the flute. I have heard that you can play the flute better than anyone else, even the shepherd himself."

The wolf was so pleased at this that he took out his flute and began to play.

When he had done, the lamb insisted him to play once more and the wolf played again.

The shepherd and the dogs heard the sound, and they came running up and fell on the wolf and the lamb was able to get back to the flock.&111&65&56
