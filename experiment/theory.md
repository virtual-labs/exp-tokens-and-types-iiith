#### Definition
Tokens correspond to the total number of word counts in a text while type corresponds to the total count of unique words in a text. We can say that language consists of various types of words and all the particular instances of these words are called tokens.

For Eg: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm.


Here,
#tokens=12
#types=11 (time has been repeated twice)

#### Type vs token distinction

The type/token distinction is related to that between universals and particulars. Tokens are concrete particular instances of a general and abstract type.
There is only one word 'the' (type) but many instances of it found on this page (token).

The type/token distinction is applicable beyond language as well. For eg:
- Beethovena's Fifth Symphony and performances of it
- The white elephant and specimens of it
- Kentucky Fried Chicken and its centres
  #### Types - (continued)

    Study this example again: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm.

    Now, we notice that 'waste' and 'wasting' share a common root. So do 'do' and 'does'.
    Do we consider them as different types? The second approach is to consider them as a single type as inflections(different grammatical forms) of the same word (type).
    Therefore,
    #tokens=12 #types(root)=9
